Data etructure
Primitive types
Arrays
Strings
Lists
Stacks and queues
Binary trees
Hash tables
Heaps
Table 1.3: Data structures
Key polnts
Know how int, char, double, etc. are represented in memory
and the primitive operations on them.
Fast access for element at an index, slow lookups (unless sorted)
and insertions. Be comfortable with notions of iteration, resizing,
partitioning, merging, etc.
Know how strings are represented in memory. Understand
basic operators such as comparison, copying, matching, joining,
splitting, etc.
Understand trade-offs with respect to arrays. Be comfortable
with iteration, insertion, and deletion within singly and doubly
linked lists. Know how to implement a list with dyramic
allocation, and with arrays.
Recognize where last-in first-out (stack) and first-in first-out
(queue) semantics are applicable. Know array and linked list
implementations.
Use for representing hierarchical data. Know about depth,
height, leaves, search path, traversal sequences, successor/predecessor
operations.
Key benefit: O(1) lookup find-max, O(logn) insertion, and
O(logn) deletion of max. Node and array representations. Minheap
variant.
Key benefit: O(1) insertions, deletions and lookups. Key disadvantages:
not suitable for order-related queries; need for resizing;
poor worst-case performance. Understand implementation
using array of buckets and collision chains. Know hash functions
for integers, strings, objects.
Key benefit: O(logn) insertions, deletions, lookups, find-min,
find-max, successor, predecessor when tree is height-balanced.
Understand node fields, pointer implementation. Be familiar
with notion of balance, and operations maintainingbalance.
Binary search trees
