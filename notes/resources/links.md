Master list of Free Resources

With the holidays coming up, I wanted to share some mostly free resources (well the books and some courses aren't free) that I've used for preparation in the past. If you have any resources that worked for you, let me know and I'll add it onto this list. My goal is to create a master list so everyone knows about which resources might be helpful.
