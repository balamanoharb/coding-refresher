# Chapter 10 ( Enumerable & Enumerator)

_What's an enumerable object in ruby ?_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- ruby links the concept of collections with enumerable module
- all classes that include Enumerable module enter into a contract relation. The class will define a method called _each_ and in turn the Enumerable module will give certain capabilities to the objects.

</details>

_Write a proof of concept each (which yields a set of colors) method by including Enumerable_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
class Rainbow
    include Enumerable
    def each
        yield "red"
        yield "orange"
        yield "yellow"
        yield "green"
        yield "blue"
        yield "indigo"
        yield "violet"
    end
end

r = Rainbow.new
r.each do |color|
    puts "Next color: #{color}"
end
```

_Boolean methods on the Enumerable object_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- all
- any
- one
- none
- include

</details>

_How boolean method works_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- It takes in a code block

</details>

_Will enumerable methods work on the Range 10.1..11.0_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- It will throw Type error

</details>
    
## Enumerable Search

_find based on code block_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].find {|n| n > 5 }
# => 6
```

</details>

_find based on lambda function and code block_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- find returns nil if not found. to overcome that we can pass a lamba

```ruby
x = lambda { -1 }
[1,2,3,4,5,nil,6,7,8,9,10].find(x) {|n| n.nil? }
# => -1
```

</details>

_use find_all_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
x = (1..10).to_a
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
x.find_all {|n| n % 2 == 0}
# => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

</details>

_select & reject_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- accepts a block and returns an array of select or what remains after rejection elements

</details>

_what does select and reject return for hash and set_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- for hash it returns a new hash matching the condition

```ruby
a = { a: 100, b: 200, c:200}
a.select {|key,val| val > 100}
# {b:200, c:300}
```

- for set it returns an array

</details>

_what operator is used for comparison in grep method_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- it uses === operator internally

```ruby
colors = %w(red orange yellow green blue indigo violet)
# => ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
colors.grep(/o/)
# => ["orange", "yellow", "indigo", "violet"]
```

</details>

_write grep in terms of select method_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
enumerable.select {|element| expression === element }
```

</details>

_How grep is used with a block_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- each result is passed to the block before returning as result array
- enumerable.grep(expression) {|item| ... }

```ruby
colors = %w(red orange yellow green blue indigo violet)
# ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
colors.grep(/o/) {|color| color.capitalize }
# ["Orange", "Yellow", "Indigo", "Violet"]
```

</details>

_How grep with block can be represented using select_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
enumerable.select {|item| expression === item}.map {|item| ... }
```

</details>

## grouping and partition

_how group_by works_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- group by takes in a block. The block returns a value. This value is used as a key. All values having the same key will be grouped as an array and assigned as value to the key.

```ruby
colors = %w(red orange yellow green blue indigo violet)
# => ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
colors.group_by {|color| color.size }
# => {3=>["red"], 6=>["orange", "yellow", "indigo", "violet"],5=>["green"], 4=>["blue"]}
```

</details>

_give example of group_by for hash_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- similar to array but returns key, value array of arrays.

```ruby
a = { a: 1, b: 11, c: 111, d: 2, e: 22, f: 222}
# => {:a=>1, :b=>11, :c=>111, :d=>2, :e=>22, :f=>222}
a.group_by {|key, val| val.to_s.size}
# {1=>[[:a, 1], [:d, 2]], 2=>[[:b, 11], [:e, 22]], 3=>[[:c, 111], [:f, 222]]}
```

</details>

_partition_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- partition takes in a block that returns true or false.
- it then returns array of arrays with two elements. the first element in array will correspond to an array of all values passing the test given in block i.e true. the second element will correspond to false.

```ruby
a = (1..10).to_a
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
a.partition {|val| val.even?}
# => [[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]
```

</details>

_accessing the first element_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- accessing first element is always feasible in an Enumerable
- in array, hash (first inserted), range or any enumberable
- enumerable.first gives the first element

</details>

_accessing the last element_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- accessing the last element might always be not possible as the enumerable might be infinite

```ruby
class Die
  include Enumerable
  def each
    loop do
       yield rand(6) + 1
    end
  end
end
```

- array and range has it though.

</details>

_how min & max work internally_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- uses the spaceship operator <=> for comparison

</details>

_why min & max are not always possible_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- for the same reason as last. to determine the min and max, it has loop over internally on all elements
- since there might infinte enumerables it's not possible, as the loop will run for ever

</details>

_min and max with and without block_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
%w(Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk).min
# => "APL"
%w(Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk).max
# => "Smalltalk

%w(Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk).min {|a,b| a.size <=> b.size}
# => "C"
%w(Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk).max {|a,b| a.size <=> b.size
# => "Smalltalk
```

</details>

_difference b/n min,man and min_by, max_by_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- min_by and max_by always accepts a block
- unlike min and max it just requires one variable

```ruby
%w(Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk).min {|val| val.size}
# => "C"
%w(Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk).max {|val| val.size}
# => "Smalltalk
```

</details>

_minmax and minmax_by_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
%w{ Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk }.minmax
# => ["APL", "Smalltalk"]
%w{ Ruby C APL Perl Smalltalk }.minmax_by {|lang| lang.size }
# => ["C", "Smalltalk"]
```

</details>

## looping

_each_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- this is the versatile method that can be used on all enumerables

</details>

_reverse_each_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- loops in reverse.
- doesn't work on infinite enumerables

```ruby
[1,2,3].reverse_each {|e| puts e * 10 }
# 10
# 20
# 30
```

</details>

_each_with_index_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- each_with_index provides additional argument to the block
- this is deprecated in favor of each.with_index

</details>

_each_slice and each_cons_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- slices to given count
- cons - slides a window of size n till the end is reached

```ruby
array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
array.each_slice(3) {|slice| p slice }
# [1, 2, 3]
# [4, 5, 6]
# [7, 8, 9]
# [10]
# => nil
array.each_cons(3) {|cons| p cons }
# [1, 2, 3]
# [2, 3, 4]
# [3, 4, 5]
# [4, 5, 6]
# [5, 6, 7]
# [6, 7, 8]
# [7, 8, 9]
# [8, 9, 10]
# => nil
```

</details>

_map_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
arr = ["apple", "orange"]
arr.map {|val| val.upcase}
#  => ["APPLE", "ORANGE"]
```

</details>

_special way of passing a method to map_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
arr = ["apple", "orange"]
arr.map(&:upcase)
#  => ["APPLE", "ORANGE"]
```

</details>

_alias for map_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- collect

</details>

_inject_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
[1,2,3,4].inject(0) {|acc,n| acc + n }
# => 10
[1,2,3,4].inject(:+)
# => 10
```

</details>

_cycle_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Enumerable#cycle yields all the elements in the object again and again in a loop. If you provide an integer argument, the loop will be run that many times. If you donâ€™t, it will be run infinitely.

```ruby
class PlayingCard
  SUITS = %w(clubs diamonds hearts spades)
  RANKS = %w(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A)
  class Deck
    attr_reader :cards
    def initialize(n=1)
      @cards = []
      SUITS.cycle(n) do |s|
        RANKS.cycle(1) do |r|
          @cards << "#{r} of #{s}"
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

</details>

_why strings are not enumerable but behaves like an enumerable_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- String class doesn't include the module Enumerable
- but it has a set of methods which creates enumerables each\_\*

</details>

_different ways of iterating over a string_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- each_byte
- each_char
- each_codepoint
- each_line

</details>

_how each line is seperated in each_line method_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- using the global line separator variable \$/
- it is usually "\n"

</details>

## Sorting

_sort_

<details>

- usually used to sort array of objects
- can be called on enumerable collection like array.
- it internally uses <=> for comparison
- sort can also take in a block which overrides the <=> operator defined

</details>

_how to make the objects stored in the array sortable_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- the objects stored in the array must have <=> operator defined, so that sort can make use of

</details>

_sort_by shortcut_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
arr.sort_by(&:to_i)
```

</details>

## Enumerator

_What's an yielder in Enumerator_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- in enumerator Enumerator::yielder is an object that is passed to the new block
- using the yielder one can yield vlaues

```ruby
e = Enumerator.new do |y|
  y.yield(1)
  y.yield(3)
  y.yield(5)
end
```

</details>

_create an enumerator and use it_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
e = Enumerator.new do |y|
  y << 1
  y << 3
  y << 5
end

e.first
# 1
e.each {|i| puts i}
# 1
# 3
# 5
#  => nil
e.take(2)
# [1, 3]
```

</details>

_Difference between Iterator and an Enumerator_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- enumerator is an object. it is not a collection but simply a machine that yields value one at a time. so it can maintain its internal state.
- an iterator is a method that yields one or more values to a block. iterator can't maintain its own state.

</details>

_use a range of 1 to 5 instead of manual yields_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
e = Enumerator.new do |y|
    (1..5).each {|i| y << i }
end
```

</details>

_how enum_for method works_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- obj.enum_for takes in any method that will yield the next element when called
- it can also take in arguments that can be passed on to the method name used to create the enumerator

```ruby
names = %w(David Black Yukihiro Matsumoto)
e = names.enum_for(:select)
e.each {|n| n.include?('a') }
e.includ?('Black')
```

</details>

_why should you be careful with the argument passed in enum_for_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- this has to do with pass by value vs pass by reference

```ruby
names = %w(David Black Yukihiro Matsumoto)
e = names.enum_for(:inject, "Names: ")
# => #<Enumerator: ["David", "Black", "Yukihiro", "Matsumoto"]:inject("Names:")>
e.each {|string, name| string << "#{name}..." }
# "Names: David...Black...Yukihiro...Matsumoto..."
```

- the original name is overwritten with the result of accumulator because of << operator

```ruby
e.each {|string, name| string << "#{name}..." }
# => "Names: David...Black...Yukihiro...Matsumoto...David...Black...Yukihiro...Matsumoto..."
```

- it should have been + operator instead

```ruby
names = %w(David Black Yukihiro Matsumoto)
e = names.enum_for(:inject, "Names: ")
e.each {|string, name| string + "#{name}..." }
#  => "Names: David...Black...Yukihiro...Matsumoto..."
e.each {|string, name| string + "#{name}..." }
#  => "Names: David...Black...Yukihiro...Matsumoto..."
```

</details>

_another way of creating enumerator from an object and method using Enumerator.new_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```ruby
Enumerator.new(obj, method_name, arg1, arg2...)
```

</details>

_what are implicit enumerator and what is it's main use case?_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- most iterator methods such as each_byte, map, select etc.. returns a corresponding enum
- it has the same effect as using enum_for
- the main use case for this is method chaining

```ruby
arr = [1,2,3]
e = arr.each
# is same as
e1 = arr.enum_for(:each)
```

</details>

_How to hook each method to any enumerator_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- each method behaves based on only what the enum yields and returns
- for example each can behave as map here

```ruby
array = %w(cat dog rabbit)
# ["cat", "dog", "rabbit"]
e = array.map
#<Enumerator: ["cat", "dog", "rabbit"]:map>
e.each {|animal| animal.capitalize } # return value is like a map
# ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit"]
```

</details>

_what's un overriding behavior of enums_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- when a class includes Enumerable and over rides one or more of its methods to suit its need, there is a way to get back the original behavior of enumerable
- just by creating a new enumerable using each

```ruby
h = { cat: "feline", dog: "canine", cow: "bovine" }
# => {:cat=>"feline", :dog=>"canine", :cow=>"bovine}
h.select {|key,value| key =~ /c/ }
# => {:cat=>"feline", :cow=>"bovine }
e = h.each
e.select {|key,value| key =~ /c/}
# [[:cat, "feline"], [:cow, "bovine"]]
```

</details>

_How passing an enum protects the object_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- In ruby a method can easily modify the passed argument object
- To protect an object from such a change but still make the method consume the object
- we can pass an enumerator of the object instead of the object itself
- this mostly works when the method just wants to iterate over the passed object

```ruby
def give_me_an_array(array)
  array << "yolo"
end

give_me_an_array(array.each)
```

</details>

_create a class CardDeck with suits and cards_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- here cards can be mutated

```ruby
class PlayingCard
  SUITS = %w(clubs diamonds hearts spades)
  RANKS = %w(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A)
  class Deck
    attr_reader :cards
    def initialize(n=1)
      @cards = []
      SUITS.cycle(n) do |s|
        RANKS.cycle(1) do |r|
          @cards << "#{r} of #{s}"
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
d = PlayingCard::Deck.new
d << "Joker"
# cards mutated
```

</details>

_make cards accessible only via enums so that its not modifiable_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- instead of attr_reader make the @cards readable through methods and return enum instead

```ruby
class PlayingCard
  SUITS = %w(clubs diamonds hearts spades)
  RANKS = %w(2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A)
  class Deck
    def initialize(n=1)
      @cards = []
      SUITS.cycle(n) do |s|
        RANKS.cycle(1) do |r|
          @cards << "#{r} of #{s}"
        end
      end
    end

    def cards
      @cards.each
    end
  end
end


d = PlayingCard::Deck.new
d << "Joker"
# with throw error method not defined
```

</details>

_next and rewind on enumerator_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- next gets the next element yielded
- rewind resets the state to beginning

```ruby
a = (1..10).to_a
# => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
e = a.each
# => #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:each>
e.next
# => 1
e.next
# => 2
e.next
# => 3
e.rewind
# => #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:each>
e.next
# => 1
```

</details>

_How to give a non enumerable object the functionalities of Enumerable_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- all it needs is a method that can yield

```ruby
module Music
  class Scale
    NOTES = %w(c c# d d# e f f# g a a# b)
    def play
      NOTES.each {|note| yield note }
    end
  end
end

scale = Music::Scale.new
e = scale.enum_for(:play)
# now scale can use all enumerable methods
e.include?("d")
```

</details>

_what is the problem with method chaining_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- It creates multiple intermediate objects based on the number of chains

</details>

_how does using enumerator solve the problem with chaining_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- Enumerator methods like each_slice are the prime candidates for these
- This optimizes because of lazy mechanism for enumerators

</details>

_get the index along with the item being enumerated_

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

- with_index method can be chained with any enumerator method to get a second argument to the block passed.
- each.with_index, map.with_index and so on

```ruby
 a = (0..10).to_a
#  => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
a.select.with_index {|val, i| i % 3 == 0}
# => [0, 3, 6, 9]
```
