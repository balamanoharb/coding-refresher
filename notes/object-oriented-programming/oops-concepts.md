# Object Oriented Programming

This term was coined by Alan Kay. It is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build application.

# What is an Object

- Object is the basic building block of OOP.
- They represent real world entities

Eg : Shopping Cart, Product Item etc.

# What is a Class

- Class is the blue print of an object.
- It defines the behavior(methods) and states(attributes) of an Object

# Principles of OOP

The four guiding principles of OOP are

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

It is simply binding and hiding data(attributes) to the outside world. When an Object keeps its data private, it restricts access to other objects which they use it. Instead the data can be accessed only through methods exposed.

> Encapsulation is hiding the state (data / attributes) of an Object to the outside by making it accessible only through methods

## Abstraction

It can thought of an extension of Encapsulation. Abstraction is hiding all irrelevant details to the outside world and only exposing the relevant details.

Internal methods and attributes to the object that are kept private to hide implementation complexities.

Eg: Imagine a stack implemented using dynamic array for storing instead of linked list. The user need not know what's used internally.

## Inheritance

Creating new classes from existing ones there by getting the behavior of existing class.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of the object to behave differently for same message based on the context.

For Eg: Chess Piece -> can take many forms like bishop, castle, knight etc. and behave differently to the move message

# OO Analysis and Design

It is a structured method for analyzing and designing a system by applying object-oriented concepts. The process can be defined as

1. Identifying the objects in a system
2. Defining relationship between objects
3. Establishing the interface of each object
4. Making a desing, which can be converted to executables using OO language.

**UML** is often used as a standard tool to document OO Analysis and design.
