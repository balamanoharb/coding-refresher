# The ABCD's of design interviews

- A - Ask good questions 
    - get the minimum viable requirements for the product/design
    - get the minimal feature set
    - how much to scale i.e how much user base
- B - Don't use buzzwords
    - without knowing anything about NoSQL don't talk about it
    - don't talk about stuff you have just read and not practiced
- C - Clear and organized thinking
    - layout the highlevel apis and interfaces before diving deep
- D - Drive discussions with 80-20 rule
    -  80% of the time you should be one leading the discussion
