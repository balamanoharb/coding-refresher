# coding-refresher

This repo is made for staying in touch with coding and be ready to solve coding problems any time.

## Language Specific Gotchas

1. Choose a language of your choice.
1. Data Types
1. Truthy and Falsy values
1. check for null values
1. Sentinel Values
1. string mutability
1. Conditional Statements
1. Loops
1. pass by value vs reference.
1. Scoping - life time of a variable
1. basic operations like map, reduce, slice, splice
1. class
1. Basic Data Structures supported by default in the language.
1. Learn to implement the basic data structures in the language.
1. Learn the time complexity of the previous data structures' operations, its implementations and learn how to implement it by hand if need arises.
1. Learn the time complexity and implementations of utility functions like sort(), reverse().
1. For Java, there are books like Effective Java, Java Concurrency in Practice, Clean Code etc.

## Must know concepts before practicing problems

- Time Complexities
- memory and stack frames
- recursion

## Must know data structures

- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Tries (they are effectively trees, but itâ€™s still good to call them out separately).
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Sorting
- Searching
