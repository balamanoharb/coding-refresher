### Conventions

#### Problem ID

- 1-S-2.1   => SI.No - Section 1 from Chapter 2
- 2-E-2.1-1 => SI.No - Excercise 1 under  Section 1 from Chapter 2
- 3-P-2-1   => SI.No - Problem 1 from Chapter 2

#### Solution File Names

- [Problem ID]-Sol-1.1 - Solution 1 of highest complexity. Sol-1.1 should probably mean iterative approach and Sol-1.2 should mean recursive approach of the same solution.

| Problem ID         |  Description  |
|--------------------|---------------|
| 1-S-2.1            |  Insertion Sort (Ascending)  | 
| 2-E-2.1-2          |  Insertion Sort (Descending)  |
| 3-E-2.1-3          |  Linear Search  |
| 4-E-2.1-4          |  Add two n-bit binary integers stored in arrays A and B. Output in n + 1 length array C  |
| 5-E-2.2-2          |  Selection Sort  |
| 6-S-2.3            |  Merge Sort with Sentinels (there is no point in using sentinels in a language like ruby (skipping this) |
| 7-E-2.3-2          |  Merge Sort without Sentinels  |
| 8-E-2.3-4          |  Insert Sort (Recursive) - Implemented in 1  |
| 9-E-2.3-5          |  Binary Search  |
| 10-E-2.3-6         |  Insertion Sort (Use Binary Search to find insertion point)  |
| 11-E-2.3-7         |  Two Sum Problem (Give n lg n solution)  |
| 12-P-2-1           |  Merge Sort with Insertion Sort on small arrays. Logic for determining k  |
| 13-P-2-2           |  Bubble Sort  |
| 14-P-2-4           |  Find Inversions in a given array A. Give n lg n solution  |
