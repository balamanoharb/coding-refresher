# coding-refresher

This repo is an ongoing implementation of algorithms and problems from these books.

0. CS106B
1. Grokking Algorithms
1. The Algorithm Design Manual
1. Intorduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition
1. Programming Pearls
1. Elements of Programming Interview
1. Programming Interviews Exposed
1. Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed

When doing different implementations of the same problem it's better to put them in a module and include in the same file instead creating one file for each as it will be easier for reference later

## 0. CS106B

- Before beginning anything complete this. It goes through all the concepts necessary for proceeding further.

### Recursion

1. print \* n times
2. find given string is a palindrome
3. find pow of n, m
4. print binary - handle negatives
5. reverseLines of a file
6. print directory tree
7. draw rectangle - fractal
8. cantor set
9. binary search

### Chapter 1

NA

### Chapter 2

1. insertion sort
2. linear search
3. add two n-bit binary integers stored in arrays A and B. Output in n + 1 length array C
4. selection sort
5. merge sort
6. binary search
7. insertion sort using binary search to find insertion point
8. two sum problem O(n.log(n)) solution
9. merge sort with insertion sort on small arrays. determine optimal size of "k" for using insertion sort
10. bubble sort
11. find inversions in a given array A O(nlog(n)) solution

### Chapter 3

3. non recursive linear algorithm for maximum sum sub array.

## Math for CS

Math topics I come accross in these books.

- logarithms
- calculating summations and series
- combinastorics - permutations - combinations
- probability theory
- algebra
- monotonicity of functions
- domain, co-domain, range
- polynomials
- exponentials
- factorials, stirling's approximation
- square root
