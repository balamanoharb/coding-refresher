This repo is an ongoing implementation of algorithms and problems from these books

1. Intorduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition
2. The Algorithm Design Manual
3. Grokking Algorithms
4. Programming Pearls
5. Elements of Programming Interview
6. Programming Interviews Exposed
7. Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed

## 1. CLRS

### Conventions

#### Problem ID

- S-2.1   => Chapter 2 - Section 1
- E-2.1-1 => Excercise under Chapter 2 Section 1 and excercise number 1
- P-2     => Problems for Chapter 2

#### Solution File Names

- *Self Challenge* - Try to implement any solution in both iterative and recursion if the time permits
- [Problem ID]-Sol-1.1 - Solution 1 of highest complexity. Sol-1.1 should probably mean iterative approach and Sol-1.2 should mean recursive approach of the same solution.

| Problem ID    |  Description  |
|---------------|---------------|
| S-2.1         |  Insertion Sort (Ascending)  |
| E-2.1-2       |  Insertion Sort (Descending)  |
| E-2.1-3       |  Linear Search (Iterative)  |
| E-2.1-4       |  Add two n-bit binary integers stored in arrays A and B. Output in n + 1 length array C  |
| E-2.2-2       |  Selection Sort  |
| S-2.3         |  Merge Sort with Sentinels  |
| E-2.3-2       |  Merge Sort without Sentinels  |
| E-2.3-4       |  Insert Sort (Recursive)  |
| E-2.3-5       |  Binary Search  |
| E-2.3-6       |  Insertion Sort (Use Binary Search to find insertion point)  |
| E-2.3-7       |  Two Sum Problem (Give n lg n solution)  |
| P-2-1         |  Merge Sort with Insertion Sort on small arrays. Logic for determining k  |
| P-2-2         |  Bubble Sort  |
| P-2-4         |  Find Inversions in a given array A. Give n lg n solution  |
