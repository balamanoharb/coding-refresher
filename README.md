# coding-refresher

This repo is made for staying in touch with coding and be ready for any tech interview any time. Keep the mind in shape. I have dumped a lot of things here. Needs to be organized.

## Language Specific Gotchas

1. Learn how to pass objects by value and reference.
2. Learn to implement the basic data structures in the language.
    - Stack
    - Linked List (Single and Double)
    - Queues (Normal, Double Ended Queue and Priority Queue)
    - HashSet - collection of unique entities
    - HashMap - dictionary
    - Binary Trees
    - Graphs
3. Learn the time complexity of the previous data structures' operations, its implementations and learn how to implement it by hand if need arises.
4. Learn the time complexity and implementations of utility functions like sort(), reverse().
5. For Java, there are books like Effective Java, Java Concurrency in Practice, Clean Code etc. Learn books similar to that and learn 10 pages everyday.

## DS and Algo

Note: For every problem solved in leetcode, see their solved solution, see solution of others in discussion forums.

1. Learn time complexity calculation - No resource found yet. I used interviewbit problems.
2. Learn Sorting algotithms for CS106B. Lerarn from both 2008 and 2015 versions. Go to interview bit and under sorting, find the problem name and solve it in leetcode.
2015 version - http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1162/lecture-videos.shtml
2008 version - http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1162/lecture-videos-2008.shtml
3. Start with Recursion. Again CS106B - Solve Towers of Hanoi, then go to Permutation of a String.
3.1 Solve those problems in leetcode. Once you solve that, similar problems can be solved easily. Refer https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/discuss/18239/a-general-approach-to-backtracking-questions-in-java-subsets-permutations-combination-sum-palindrome-partioning. Implement similarly in your language of choice.

# The ABCD's of design interviews
A - Ask good questions 
    - get the minimum viable requirements for the product/design
    - get the minimal feature set
    - how much to scale i.e how much user base
B - Don't use buzzwords
    - without knowing anything about NoSQL don't talk about it
    - don't talk about stuff you have just read and not practiced
C - Clear and organized thinking
    - layout the highlevel apis and interfaces before diving deep
D - Drive discussions with 80-20 rule
    -  80% of the time you should be one leading the discussion
