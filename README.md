# coding-refresher

This repo is an ongoing implementation of algorithms and problems from these books.

0. CS106B
1. Grokking Algorithms
1. The Algorithm Design Manual
1. Intorduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition
1. Programming Pearls
1. Elements of Programming Interview
1. Programming Interviews Exposed
1. Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed

When doing different implementations of the same problem it's better to put them in a module and include in the same file instead creating one file for each as it will be easier for reference later

## 0. CS106B

- Before beginning anything complete this. It goes through all the concepts necessary for proceeding further.

### Recursion

It generally follows this format

```python
def recursive_function(parameter):
  if(base_condition):
    # end the recursion
    # return result if necessary
  else:
    # do one unit of work
    # pass off the rest of work by calling the same function
```

1. print \* n times
2. find given string is a palindrome
3. find pow of n, m
4. print binary - handle negatives
5. reverseLines of a file
6. print directory tree
7. draw rectangle - fractal
8. cantor set
9. binary search

#### More Recursion Practice Problems

1. reverse a string
2. Given a binary pattern that contains ‘?’ wildcard character at few positions, find all possible combinations of binary strings that can be formed by replacing the wildcard character by either 0 or 1.


What is important in learning a concept is practice.
