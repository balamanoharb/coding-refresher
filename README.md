# coding-refresher

This repo is an ongoing implementation of algorithms and problems from these books.

1. Grokking Algorithms
2. The Algorithm Design Manual
3. Intorduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition
4. Programming Pearls
5. Elements of Programming Interview
6. Programming Interviews Exposed
7. Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Ed

When doing different implementations of the same problem it's better to put them in a module and include in the same file instead creating one file for each

## 1. Grokking algorithms

## 3. CLRS

### Chapter 1

NA

### Chapter 2

1. insertion sort
2. linear search
3. add two n-bit binary integers stored in arrays A and B. Output in n + 1 length array C
4. selection sort
5. merge sort
6. binary search
8. insertion sort using binary search to find insertion point
9. two sum problem O(n.log(n)) solution
10. merge sort with insertion sort on small arrays. determine optimal size of "k" for using insertion sort
11. bubble sort
12. find inversions in a given array A O(nlog(n)) solution

### Chapter 3

NA

### Chapter 4
1. maximum sum sub array O(n.log(n))
2. maximum sum sub array O(n^2)
3. non recursive linear algorithm for maximum sum sub array.

## Math for CS

Math topics I come accross in these books.

- logarithms
- calculating summations and series
- combinastorics - permutations - combinations
- probability theory
- algebra
- monotonicity of functions
- domain, co-domain, range
- polynomials
- exponentials
- factorials, stirling's approximation
- square root
