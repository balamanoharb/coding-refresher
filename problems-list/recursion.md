Recursion and Memoization are always top down

1. print 1 to n
2. sum of 1 to n given n.
3. sum of an array
4. convert an array such that a[i] = a[i] + sum of all elements before it
5. factorial using recursion
6. power of n
7. tower of hanoi
8. print a list
9. print a list in reverse
10. binary tree in order traversal
11. binary tree pre order traversal
12. bubble sort
13. mathematical table of n from 1 to 10
14. fibonacci using recursion
15. fibonacci using memozation
16. fibonacci using dp
17. There are N stations in a route, starting from 0 to N-1. A train moves from first station (0) to last station (N-1) in only forward direction. The cost of ticket between any two stations is given. Find the minimum cost of travel from station 0 to station N-1.
    1. Eg: cost[4][4] = {
       {0 , 10, 75, 94},
       {-1, -1, 35, 50},
       {-1, -1, 0, 80},
       {-1, -1, -1, 0}
       }
18. Given a matrix of order N\*N. What are the total number of ways in which we can move from top-lelft cell (arr[0][0]) to the bottom-right cell (arr[N-1][n-1], given thaat we can only move either downward or rightward).
19. Find length of longest substring of a given string of digits, such that sum of digits in the first half and second half of the substring is same. Solve this with brute force and then optimize with memoization. For example,
    1. Input : "142124"
    2. Output : 6
20. Write a program compute fibonacci(n) in log n time.
21. factorial using memoization
22. factorial using dp
23. pre order traversal of a binary tree
24. Given a binary tree, For each node, add sum of all the nodes in tis hierarchy to its value.
25. In combinatorics, Combination is defined recursively. C(n, m) = C(n - 1, m) + C(n-1, m-1). Write a program to find this through Dynamic Programming and Recursion
26.
