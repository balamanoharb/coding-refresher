# 1. Design a Vending Machine
You need to design a Vending Machine which follows the following requirements
Accepts coins of 1,5,10,25, 50 Cents, i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and quarter as well as 1 and 2 dollar note
Allow user to select products e.g. CANDY(10), SNACK(50), NUTS(90), Coke(25), Pepsi(35), Soda(45)
Allow users to take a refund by canceling the request.
Return the selected product and remaining change if any
Allow reset operation for vending machine supplier

# 2. Design a Lift system
An elevator is a combination of at least two elevators, one going up and another coming down. The goal is to minimize the waiting time of the user. Make sure you how your design will evolve if a lift is installed on high rise buildings over 20 floors.

How many lifts you need to server 40 floors with waiting time no less than 30 seconds on average. Think about the parking strategy of your lift, i.e. which floor they should be resting or should they keep going up or down, etc.


# 3. Desing and implement LRU cache
An LRU cache stands for Least Recently Used. It should remove the least recently used item from the cache to make space for a new item. Think about the persistence strategy of the cache. how do you build-cache after crash etc


# 4. Design a Traffic Controller System for a Junction
You need to design software to control traffic lights at a junction where traffic is coming from four sides. It should follow basic traffic rules, allow a pedestrian to cross the road, and traffic to pass in a reasonable time. How do you optimize the waiting time with respect to high traffic from one direction, like during morning and evening rush hours?
